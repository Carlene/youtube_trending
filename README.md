My capstone project is about the correlation between trending videos and the creator who made them. 

I believed trending videos would be from the same biggest channels, and fewer than half of all US creators would have only one trending video. But I wanted to know for sure: do trending videos tend to be from the same creators or is there a more diverse pool than I thought?
