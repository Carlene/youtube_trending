My capstone project looks at creators with multiple trending videos vs. creators who only have one.

I believed trending videos would be from the same biggest channels, and fewer than half of all US creators would have only one trending video. But I wanted to know for sure: do trending videos tend to be from the same creators or is there a more diverse pool than I thought? And how do the view counts for the multi-trending creators compare to those who have one trending video?
