Capstone ideas:

1) Times/Days trending videos start trending in the US
I can ask when's the best time to upload, what the average time between uploading and trending starts, if there's a common length of the videos, and/or which category of video is best to make if you want a trending video

2) Look at how many trending videos have a topic in common. I can check the tags, channel names, titles, description

3) Do trending videos tend to be from the same creator is there a more diverse pool? It seems obvious that popular people will tend to have more trending videos, but how easy is it for someone who doesn't have many subs to get a trending video (would have to look at info outside the data, might be unfeasible)
